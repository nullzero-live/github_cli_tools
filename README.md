# Nullzero's GitHub Action CLI Tool :hammer_and_wrench:

Welcome to Nullzero's GitHub Action CLI Tool – This tool is a part of the DependMLOps project, which is all about orchestrating your MLOps tools seamlessly. As of 8th November 2023, its become an official side project huzzah. :tada:

What is working so far? Auth, and a basic flow to handle a text file and dump it into a json.

## Status
**Under Development** :construction: – We're actively coding away to bring you the most handy features for your development workflow.

## Goals for the Project :dart:

### General Objectives:
- **Developer-Centric:** Offer a fun and varied selection of arguments tailored for developers.
- **Ease of Access:** Simplify authentication and repository retrieval using your GitHub userID.

### Building Blocks:
- **ToDo Integrator:** The first version allows you to push a local ToDo list in text format to GitHub and logs it as an issue.

### Future Aspirations :bulb::
- **Test Runner:** Run tests and present results in a format that's easy to understand.
- **CI Integration:** Automate test execution with continuous integration tools.
- **Code Scribe:** Automatically create a directory tree and write meaningful descriptions.
- **DocString Writer:** Scan current files and craft docstrings for methods (a feature that may shine in VSCode).
- **Dockerfile and README Autowriter:** Use LLM integration to write Dockerfiles and READMEs based on your directory structure.
